## üõ†Ô∏è Integration Recommendations

- **Prioritize Greenhouse, Lever, SmartRecruiters** for direct API integration.
- **Fallback to scraping** for Workday, iCIMS, Ashby when APIs aren‚Äôt exposed.
- **Map job fields** into your unified Supabase schema: `title`, `company`, `location`, `url`, `description`, etc.
- **Track job source** using a `source_type` field (e.g. `API`, `scraper`, `manual`).
