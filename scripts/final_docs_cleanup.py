## Docusaurus Integration

This documentation is integrated with Docusaurus for professional presentation. The legacy Docusaurus files are preserved for compatibility while the new organized structure provides better navigation and maintenance.

## Current State

The documentation has been reorganized into a new structure while preserving the existing Docusaurus setup for compatibility.

## New Structure Benefits

- **Epic-based organization** for better feature documentation
- **Consistent patterns** across all feature documentation
- **Better navigation** and discoverability
- **Scalable architecture** for future features

## Migration Path

To fully integrate the new structure with Docusaurus:

1. Update `sidebars.ts` to reflect new epic structure
2. Update `docusaurus.config.ts` navigation
3. Create epic-specific documentation pages
4. Migrate legacy content to new format

## Compatibility

The legacy files have been moved to preserve existing links while enabling the new structure to be developed in parallel.
