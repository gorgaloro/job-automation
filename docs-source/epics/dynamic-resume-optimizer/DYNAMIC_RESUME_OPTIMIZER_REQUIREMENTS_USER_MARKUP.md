# Dynamic Resume Optimizer - Comprehensive Business Requirements

## Overview
The Dynamic Resume Optimizer is a web application that helps Allen Walker optimize his resume for specific job descriptions through AI-powered analysis, comprehensive resume display, and intelligent suggestions.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Job Analysis Section (Left Panel)
**Purpose**: Parse job description and provide comprehensive analysis

<!-- USER COMMENT: Job description should be stored in a database as part of the job description ingestion process. Ingestion will come from APIs we have already tested out from job boards. Ingestion could also come from URLs user manually inputs on a front end form/process we have not completely built out yet. We will need to determine the exact fields we need to store in the database for each job description and how they will be used downstream. But for now we can use sample data, and identify data gaps as we go. I'm considering the Job Analysis Section in draft form right now.-->

**Required Components**:
- **Overall Match Score**: Numerical score (0-100%) showing resume compatibility with job
- **Job Information Display**:
  - Job Title
  - Company Name
  - Location
  - Salary Range (if available)
- **Company Summary**: AI-generated company overview including:
  - Industry
  - Company size
  - Growth stage
  - Key business focus
- **Position Summary**: AI-generated role summary including:
  - Key responsibilities
  - Required qualifications
  - Growth opportunities
- **Keyword Analysis**:
  - **Matched Keywords**: Keywords from job description found in resume (green tags)
  - **Missing Keywords**: Keywords from job description NOT in resume (red tags)
- **Job Summary**: Detailed description of the role and expectations

### 2. Optimized Resume Section (Right Panel)
**Purpose**: Display Allen's complete resume with hierarchical controls and scoring

<!-- USER COMMENT: Everytime the Dynamic Resume Optimizer loads, it will load a baselined resume template from a database that is best aligned with the job description. Right now we are testing with one version of a baselined resume I have provided in the file Resume - Allen Walker.md. However, future development iterations will have multiple saved baseline resumes that represent a different set of skills the user has. For example, there might be a sales resume, construction resume, etc. The user will first load all of their resume templates into the system. Then, when the user goes to optimize their resume for a specific job description, the system will load the best aligned resume template from the database. This is future functionality, but for now we can use the sample resume I have provided. Also, on page load the AI Generator should run and provide suggestions. I'll specifify how those suggestions should work in the resume structure below. -->

## Resume Section Structure

### Core Resume Sections (Always Included)

#### **Personal Information**
- Name, contact details, LinkedIn, portfolio
- Always visible, no checkbox controls

<!-- USER COMMENT: We will need to grapically update this section to look cleaner. This information should be stored in a database and loaded when the user goes to optimize their resume for a specific job description. This information should be stored at the user level, not the resume level since contact information is global. Checkbox controls should be included. And full social media profiles should be included. This would include things such as Github, LinkedIn, Portfolio, X, FB, etc. We can evaluate what should be checked by default on load. -->

#### **Executive Summary**
- AI-optimized summary text with inline editing
- Relevance score badge
- AI suggestions available (3 strategic suggestions)
- Always included section

<!-- USER COMMENT: Summary should be no more than 700 characters long, and ideally 700 charachters. All AI suggestions should be the same length. Output of this will be sent to graphically designed PDF file and needs to take up a set amount of space on the document. AI should generate 3 alternative exectutive Summaries. Original summary and AI summaries should be editable on the page with inclusion/exclusions check boxes.  -->

#### **Strategic Impact** (Career Highlights)
- Top 3-5 career achievements with hierarchical checkboxes
- Each achievement with:
  - Individual checkbox for inclusion/exclusion
  - Relevance score percentage
  - Category label (e.g., "Program Leadership", "Revenue Impact")
  - Inline editing capability
- AI suggestions available (3 transformation suggestions)
- Always included section

<!-- USER COMMENT: Include all strategic impact achievents stored across all resume versions. For example, there might be some roles that are more sales focused even though my baseline resume is more program management focused. I want to be able to manually select which achievements to include/exclude. Also, achievements should be editable on the page with inclusion/exclusions check boxes. And I should be able to manually reorder achievements via drag and drop. AI suggestions should be limited to 3, and should be based on what scores the highest based on information in my entire resume and the selected job description. -->

#### **Professional Experience**

<!-- USER COMMENT: Professional experience should be loaded from multiple related database tables. One table stores the job title, company, location, dates across all resumes - this global information is not specific to any one resume. Another table stores the bullet points. Each bullet point should be associated with a job and a unique default resume. When the Dyanmic Resume Optimizer loads, it selects the best aligned resume template from the database. However, a user should be able to select a different resume template from the database. And a user should be able to manually update or change all information with inline edits, including job title, company, location, dates, and bullet points. We'll need to work out a clean workflow how each default resume gets updated. This is where the 'Reset to Baseline' and 'Save to Baseline' come in. We also might need to be able to save to a new baseline, or output resume as a one-time PDF. The outputted resume will be stored in a new database associated with the downstream job application process. This functionality and workflow is still in development. Again, with this structure in place, a default set of jobs titles and bullet points should be loaded from the database, AI provides three suggestions for each job title and bullet point, and the user can manually select which to include/exclude, as well as edit in line. Each job title and bullet point should have a relevance score percentage and category label. -->
